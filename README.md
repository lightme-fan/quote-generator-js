# My project

## These are steps which I did

- I wrote the first and the second quotations in which of them contain three sentences .

- I set the function to randomly generate them by using 'Math.floor' and 'Math.random'.

- Lastly, I tried to use prompt to check if the input which the users enter are correct.

### Note:
I tried to do my best, but I'm not sure what I did are correct.

- I do not know why? But when the users enter a number in the console in browser, the result is not what I expect. I tried to solve this problem but time is limited, so I couldn't figure it out.
